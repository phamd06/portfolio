## Western Sydney University Cyberattack October 2025
On October 23rd 2025, Western Sydney University released an official press release that announced the event of a cybersecurity attack that impacted the university's integral systems, leading to unauthorised access and collection of students and staffs' personal information.

This attack is a clear example of how multiple fundamental cybersecurity aspects have been affected. These include:
1. Unauthorised System Access - The attacker of this event gained access to the university's systems, which leads to the clear indication of terrible security. This calls for stronger access control, perhaps larger authentication processes and system infrastructure changes
2. Third-Party Risk - One of the attacker's objectives was clearly access to personal information of student and staff. The method in which this was accessed was through third party systems not managed by the university however was evidently connected to them. Universities across the world rely on cloud based third party services heavily and this event is a prime example that shows security around information inheritance must be strengthed.
3. Incompetent Monitoring - In the public announcement of October of 2025, the university mentions there had been numerous unusual activity occuring between June and September which had been reproted and yet no strong action had been made to initiate reporting. This insuinates stronger reporting mininums, the need for continuous security monitoring and a faster detection algorithm.
